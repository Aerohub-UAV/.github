## Our Core Areas

### 1. Drone Systems Development
We design, prototype, and build custom UAV platforms tailored for industrial tasks. Our experience spans multi-rotor platforms for cargo, inspection, and mapping, with increasing focus on modular, scalable systems.

### 2. Drone Operations Infrastructure
We are building tools to support drone fleet management, operational safety, and regulatory compliance. This includes both software (like mission dashboards, AI-assisted decision tools) and hardware (custom components, ground support tools).

### 3. Training and Research Enablement
We support drone research teams with consulting, fabrication support, access to components, and prototyping equipment. We also run trainings in drone development, CAD, AI for aerial systems, and prototyping.

## What We’re Building on GitHub

Our GitHub profile will feature both open and closed-source projects. While we’re just getting started publicly, the following are areas we will be releasing code in:

- Software for managing aerial operations (flight logging, pre/post-flight checklists, etc.)
- Tools for drone R&D (airfoil visualization, hardware testing scripts, telemetry parsers)
- AI models and tools for drone perception and data analysis
- Utility libraries and interfaces for drone-specific workflows


Stay tuned for updates or get in touch to contribute.
